# Pacemaker
Real-time software that implements a working pacemaker, with the use of Simulink and Python 

Working implementation of the following modes: AOO, VOO, AAI, VVI

The FRDM K64F microcontroller facilitates the flow of information by receiving input from the DCM through serial communication, processing it in real-time using Simulink, and finally outputting the results to the heartView for visualization.
